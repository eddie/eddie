## Hello 👋

I'm Eddie, a curious Software Engineer from the UK with over a decade of experience in building products for the web. 

- I run a super small software development company called Hakobox
- Day-to-day I work a lot with React+TypeScript and FastAPI/Django on the backend.
- I have a strong background with CI/CD, currently mostly in Google Cloud, leveraging Terraform.

- I'm currently learning more about developing against bare-metal for Arm devices.
